## Applications_of_Linked_Document_Topic_Models_to_Spatially_Embedded_Networks.pdf 
This document is a project paper for STAT241A, a class on probabilistic graphical models. We employed the Linked-PLSA-LDA (LPL) hyperlinked document topic model to describe location behaviors of a social network of Twitter users in the Bay Area. Instead of documents, words, and hyperlinks, we model people, locations, and social network connections. Topics are latent communities, defined by the locations where people and their friends conduct activities. 

The work is currently being extended to use the LDA model to analyze the same data set. We will compare the posterior probabilities of community membership produced by the LPL and non-linked LDA models to Asses the impact of including social network ties.

## The_SmartBay_Project.pdf
This is an incomplete paper! Members of my team have created a generative Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM) to predict the locations and activities of travelers in the Bay Area. The novel feature of this model is that it is trained on large-scale passively collected cellular data. My task is to evaluate how effective this model for generating realistic travel patterns in a synthetic population of agents.
