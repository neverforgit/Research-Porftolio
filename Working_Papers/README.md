*CROWD RATING SYSTEMS IN LOCATION CHOICE*
IN SUBMISSION FOR TRB 2018  
The role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in travel decision making has been well studied with regard to routing and network conditions. But little research exists investigating the impact of crowd rating system (CRS), such as Yelp, in location choice, especially for discretionary activities. A proof-of-concept implementation of an agent-based model of discretionary activity location choices is presented. Agents consult a CRS and weigh ratings against estimated travel costs when choosing discretionary activity locations. It is found that the CRS behavior significantly changes the distributions of location popularities. Results also indicate that market concentration occurs as CRS ratings come to dominate agent decision making.

## Applications_of_Linked_Document_Topic_Models_to_Spatially_Embedded_Networks.pdf 
*Applications of Linked Document Topic Models to Spatially Embedded Social Networks* 
This document is a project paper for STAT241A, a class on probabilistic graphical models. We employed the Linked-PLSA-LDA (LPL) hyperlinked document topic model to describe location behaviors of a social network of Twitter users in the Bay Area. Instead of documents, words, and hyperlinks, we model people, locations, and social network connections. Topics are latent communities, defined by the locations where people and their friends conduct activities. 

The work is currently being extended to use the LDA model to analyze the same data set. We will compare the posterior probabilities of community membership produced by the LPL and non-linked LDA models to Asses the impact of including social network ties.

*The SmartBay project: connected mobility in the SanFrancisco Bay Area* 
The Smart Bay project extends the state-of-the-art in activity-based simulations by incorporating the anonymized data stream from the cellular network infrastructure. The efficacy of cellulary data in activity-based simulations is evaluated by comparing three scenarios: a control scenario using a traditional HHTS-based activity model, an activity model based only on cellular data, and a hybrid model using both the HHTS and cellular models.  

Some network errors were identified that caused unrealistic travel times. Before publication, we need to redo the calibration and validation runs using the corrected network.
