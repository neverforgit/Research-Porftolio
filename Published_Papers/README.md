## Better_Pen_and_Paper_Surveys_for_Transportation.pdf  
This is a methodological paper on the survey design mechanism we developed for my research on shared bikes and electric bikes in Beijing. Due to time and budget constraints, we were not able to develop an interactive mobile for collection stated and revealed preference data. Instead we used a pen-and-paper mechanism that captures many of the advantages of SP-pivoting methods.
