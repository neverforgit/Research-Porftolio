## ITM_lightning_talk.pdf   
This was a 5-minute lightening talk I gave at the 6’th annual Transportation Research Board [Innovations in Travel Modeling] (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conferences/2016/ITM/Program.pdf) conference. It highlights the results of using one month of anonymized cellular data to study the mobility needs of a small population: the residents and workers on Treasure Island. This was a proof-of-concept project that supports [SFCTA’s Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency] (http://www.sfcta.org/TIMMA_home).   

Two surprising results are highlighted on slides two and three. First, the spatial extent of regular commuters is far greater than expected. Second, from the temporal distributions, we see that there is actually an influx of workers in the morning.   


## TRB14_presentation.pdf   
This is a presentation from the 2014 Transportation Research Board conference on the work presented in my paper, [Better Pen-and-Paper Surveys for Transportation Research in Developing Countries] (https://github.com/neverforgit/Research_Portfolio/blob/master/Published_Papers/Better_Pen_and_Paper_Surveys_for_Transportation.pdf).
